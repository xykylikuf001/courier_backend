    Convert an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) portion to a URI
    portion that is suitable for inclusion in a URL.

    This is the algorithm from section 3.1 of RFC 3987, slightly simplified
    since the input is assumed to be a string rather than an arbitrary byte
    stream.

    Take an IRI (string or UTF-8 bytes, e.g. '/I â™¥ Django/' or
    b'/I \xe2\x99\xa5 Django/') and return a string containing the encoded
    result with ASCII chars only (e.g. '/I%20%E2%99%A5%20Django/').
